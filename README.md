## 🗣️ Multilingual content

- The site ships with English (`en`) and Vietnamese (`vi`) locales.
- Blog posts live in `_posts/<locale>/`. Add new English posts to `_posts/en/` and Vietnamese posts to `_posts/vi/`.
- Keep the same slug (file name) across locales to link translations of the same article.
- Front matter follows the existing shape (`title`, `date`, `coverImage`, `author`, etc.). Assets remain relative to `public/`.
- If a translation is missing, the site gracefully falls back to the English version while staying on the selected language.
